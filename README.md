Create a new class, MyExponentClass that contains three different methods to raise a base to an exponent in different ways:

- One that uses the Math.pow() method

- One that uses an iterative solution

- One that uses a recursive solution

Write a driver (test) program that calculates raising a number to the largest number possible power and time the calculations to see if you can detect a difference.
